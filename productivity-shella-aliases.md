As Flutter developers, we often perform repetitive tasks — like cleaning builds, getting dependencies, and running code generators. While these tasks are necessary, they can quickly become time-consuming and disrupt our focus. Luckily, there's a simple productivity hack that can help: shell aliases.

## What Are Shell Aliases?

Shell aliases are shortcuts you can create for commonly used commands in your terminal. Instead of typing out a long command every time, you set up a short keyword that performs the same action. It's a small change that can save you a lot of time and keystrokes throughout the day.

### Common Repetitive Tasks in Flutter Development

If you've been developing with Flutter, you're probably familiar with the following commands:

  - Cleaning your project (flutter clean)
  - Getting dependencies (flutter pub get)
  - Upgrading dependencies (flutter pub upgrade)
  - Running build_runner (dart run build_runner build)
  - Watching build_runner (dart run build_runner watch)


These are vital for any Flutter project but can get tedious when you have to run them frequently. Shell aliases help you automate these repetitive tasks.

### My Experience with Shell Aliases

A while back, I noticed that I was spending too much time typing the same commands repeatedly. It was distracting me from focusing on actual coding. That's when I decided to create a few aliases to speed things up, and they've been a game-changer for me.
